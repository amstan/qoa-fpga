# Pure Python QOA Implementation

Quite OK Audio Format implemented in Python.

The purpose of this is to implement QOA as an experiment in an easy to
introspect matter, more as a toolkit to compare against when testing
other implementations (in a verilog testbench).

**Do not expect this to be fast**, in fact it might be too slow to for real
time 44100 audio with modern hardware. While I might improve performance
it won't be to the detrement of readability and simplicity.
